# ðŸ“š Word-Scrambler-Game

"Word Scrambler Game" is an interactive and educational web-based game created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API integration. Upon loading the resizable webpage, the game selects a random word and displays it in a scrambled form on the screen. The player's objective is to unscramble the word within a challenging 30-second time limit by entering the correct word into a designated text box.

To assist players in their quest, a hint button is available. Clicking the hint button reveals the definition of the scrambled word, aiding players in their efforts to decipher it.

Players have a maximum of 10 attempts to solve each word, and their final score is displayed in a pop-up message at the end of the game. "Word Scrambler Game" offers an engaging and fun way to test and expand your vocabulary while challenging your word-solving skills.
